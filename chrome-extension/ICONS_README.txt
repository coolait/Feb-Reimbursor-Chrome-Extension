ICON FILES NEEDED:

You need to create three icon files for the extension:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)  
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

You can create simple icons or use any image editor to create them.
Place them in the chrome-extension folder.

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares as icons.
